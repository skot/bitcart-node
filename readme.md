## The bitcart
**This project is unfinished and on hold until the supply of CM4 8GB improves**

This is a Raspberry Pi CM4 carrier board optimized for being a bitcoin node.

It is heavily based on the official [Raspberry Pi CM4 Carrier Board](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4-io-board/)

[Still very much WIP. The schematic is mostly done, and the PCB layout is started. Needs a lot more work, and testing!]
## features
- Uses the RPi CM4 (use the CM4108032 with 8GB RAM and 32GB eMMC storage)
- M.2 M-Key slot for NVMe SSD storage. (Need that 1TB+ for bitcoin core!)
- Powered by 20W PoE+
- Gigabit ethernet
- USB port for debugging
